# Final-Code
All simulation and generation code for Advanced Photovoltaics-Photonics and Devices Group's SCC Project

Using refractive index data of different materials, optical properies like transmission, reflection, and color could be generated for
different combinations of materials. For solar controlled coatings, one would want high transmission in the visible region of the spectrum,
high reflectance everywhere else, and neutral color. 

The code can closely predict the experimental results, and optimize for different user priorities using a number of methods like root mean
square curve matching, genetic algorithm, and so on.
